# Send an Email to Entire Audience

This option is nearly identical to the [Send To Mailing List](mailing-list.md) options with only a few differences.

## Send to All Options

[MadMimi's Import and Send to a List Documentation](https://madmimi.com/developer/mailer/send_to_all) should give you an idea
of what you need to send to the API.  This options object makes some of the methods easier.

### Method Reference

All methods from the [Mailing List Options](mailing-list.md) are available with the exception of `setLists()` and `setMergeData()`
