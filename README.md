# madmimi-api-php
An up-to-date PHP library for integrating with the madmimi.com API.

This is a library that I've been making to support my particular needs at <https://www.smallshopsunited.com> so it
may not be as fully featured as you might expect.  However, I'm more than willing to implement methods or accept
pull requests to add the functionality you need.
